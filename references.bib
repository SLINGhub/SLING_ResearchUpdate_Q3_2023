  abstract = {Risk stratification is critical for the early identification of high-risk individuals and disease prevention. Here we explored the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-derived metabolomic profiles to inform on multidisease risk beyond conventional clinical predictors for the onset of 24\,common conditions, including metabolic, vascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal and neurological diseases and cancers. Specifically, we trained a neural network to learn disease-specific metabolomic states from 168\,circulating metabolic markers measured in 117,981\,participants with \textasciitilde 1.4\,million person-years of follow-up from the UK Biobank and validated the model in four independent cohorts. We found metabolomic states to be associated with incident event rates in all the investigated conditions, except breast cancer. For 10-year outcome prediction for 15\,endpoints, with and without established metabolic contribution, a combination of age and sex and the metabolomic state equaled or outperformed established predictors. Moreover, metabolomic state added predictive information over comprehensive clinical variables for eight common diseases, including type\,2 diabetes, dementia and heart failure. Decision curve analyses showed that predictive improvements translated into clinical utility for a wide range of potential decision thresholds. Taken together, our study demonstrates both the potential and limitations of NMR-derived metabolomic profiles as a multidisease assay to inform on the risk of many common diseases simultaneously.},

Lipids are complex molecules comprising many isomeric and isobaric species, necessitating detailed analysis to enable interpretation of biological significance. Our expanded targeted lipidomics platform (569 species across 32 classes) allows for detailed lipid separation and characterisation. In this study we examined peripheral samples of two cohorts (AIBL, n\,=\,1112 and ADNI, n\,=\,800). We are able to identify concordant peripheral signatures associated with prevalent AD arising from lipid pathways including; ether lipids, sphingolipids (notably GM3 gangliosides) and lipid classes previously associated with cardiometabolic disease (phosphatidylethanolamine and triglycerides). We subsequently identified similar lipid signatures in both cohorts with future disease. Lastly, we developed multivariate lipid models that improved classification and prediction. Our results provide a holistic view between the lipidome and AD using a comprehensive approach, providing targets for further mechanistic investigation.},

Multiple lipid biomarkers and C-reactive protein were measured in addition to plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0), and Cer(d18:1/24:1). Subsequently, the association between high-risk ceramides and CV mortality was investigated in the prospective Special Program University Medicine\textemdash Inflammation in Acute Coronary Syndromes (SPUM-ACS) cohort (n = 1637), conducted in four Swiss university hospitals. Finally, the results were validated in Bergen Coronary Angiography Cohort (BECAC), a prospective Norwegian cohort study of stable CAD patients. Ceramides, especially when used in ratios, were significantly associated with CV death in all studies, independent of other lipid markers and C-reactive protein. Adjusted odds ratios per standard deviation for the Cer(d18:1/16:0)/Cer(d18:1/24:0) ratio were 4.49 (95\% CI, 2.24\textendash 8.98), 1.64 (1.29\textendash 2.08), and 1.77 (1.41\textendash 2.23) in the Corogene, SPUM-ACS, and BECAC studies, respectively. The Cer(d18:1/16:0)/Cer(d18:1/24:0) ratio improved the predictive value of the GRACE score (net reclassification improvement, NRI = 0.17 and {$\Delta$}AUC = 0.09) in ACS and the predictive value of the Marschner score in stable CAD (NRI = 0.15 and {$\Delta$}AUC = 0.02).Distinct plasma ceramide ratios are significant predictors of CV death both in patients with stable CAD and ACS, over and above currently used lipid markers. This may improve the identification of high-risk patients in need of more aggressive therapeutic interventions.},

With lipidomics datasets becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through integration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and reanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data inspection, normalization, and uni- and multivariate analyses, displaying results as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class, chain length, and total unsaturation data, we also developed and implemented a novel lipid set enrichment analysis. A companion online guide with two live example datasets is presented at https://www.lipidr.org/. We expect that the ease of use and innovative features of lipidr will allow the lipidomics research community to gain novel detailed insights from lipidomics data.},

Data curation in liquid chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (LC\textendash MS) involves the removal of biologically non-relevant features (retention time, m/z pairs) to retain only high-quality data for subsequent analysis and interpretation. The present work introduces TidyMS, a package for the Python programming language for preprocessing LC\textendash MS data for quality control (QC) procedures in untargeted metabolomics workflows. It is a versatile strategy that can be customized or fit for purpose according to the specific metabolomics application. It allows performing quality control procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability in LC\textendash MS measurements, and it allows preprocessing metabolomics data to obtain cleaned matrices for subsequent statistical analysis. The capabilities of the package are shown with pipelines for an LC\textendash MS system suitability check, system conditioning, signal drift evaluation, and data curation. These applications were implemented to preprocess data corresponding to a new suite of candidate plasma reference materials developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; hypertriglyceridemic, diabetic, and African-American plasma pools) to be used in untargeted metabolomics studies in addition to NIST SRM 1950 Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma. The package offers a rapid and reproducible workflow that can be used in an automated or semi-automated fashion, and it is an open and free tool available to all users.},

  abstract = {Objective: While the risk of acute coronary events has been associated with biological variability of circulating cholesterol, the association with variability of other atherogenic lipids remains less understood. We evaluated the longitudinal variability of 284 lipids and investigated their association with asymptomatic coronary atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: Circulating lipids were extracted from fasting blood samples of 83 community-sampled symptom-free participants (age 41\textendash 75 years), collected longitudinally over 6 months. Three types of coronary plaque volume (calcified, lipid-rich, and fibrotic) were quantified using computed tomography coronary angiogram. We first deconvoluted between-subject (CVg) and within-subject (CVw) lipid variabilities. We then tested whether the mean lipid abundance was different across groups categorized by Framingham risk score and plaques phenotypes (lipid-rich, fibrotic, and calcified). Finally, we investigated whether visit-to-visit variability of each lipid was associated with plaque burden. Most lipids (72.5\%) exhibited higher CVg than CVw. Among the lipids (n=145) with 1.2-fold higher CVg than CVw, 26 species including glycerides and ceramides were significantly associated with Framingham risk score and the 3 plaque phenotypes (false discovery rate {$<$}0.05). In an exploratory analysis of person-specific visit-to-visit variability without multiple testing correction, high variability of 3 lysophospholipids (lysophosphatidylethanolamines 16:0, 18:0, and lysophosphatidylcholine O-18:1) was associated with lipid-rich and fibrotic (noncalcified) plaque volume while high variability of diacylglycerol 18:1\_20:0, triacylglycerols 52:2, 52:3, and 52:4, ceramide d18:0/20:0, dihexosylceramide d18:1/16:0, and sphingomyelin 36:3 was associated with calcified plaque volume. Conclusions: High person-specific longitudinal variation of specific nonsterol lipids is associated with the burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Larger studies are needed to confirm these exploratory findings.},

MRMkit capitalizes on the richness of large-sample data in capturing peak shapes and interference patterns of individual transitions across many samples and deliver fully automated, reproducible peak integration results in a scalable and time-efficient manner. In addition to fast and accurate peak integration, the tool also provides reliable data normalization functions and quality metrics along with visualizations for fast data quality evaluation. MRMkit learns the retention time offset patterns by user specified compound class and makes recommendations for peak picking in multi-modal ion chromatograms.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Quantitative MS of human plasma lipids is a promising technology for translation into clinical applications. Current MS-based lipidomic methods rely on either direct infusion (DI) or chromatographic lipid separation methods (including reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction LC). However, the use of lipid markers in laboratory medicine is limited by the lack of reference values, largely because of considerable differences in the concentrations measured by different laboratories worldwide. These inconsistencies can be explained by the use of different sample preparation protocols, method-specific calibration procedures, and other experimental and data-reporting parameters, even when using identical starting materials. Here, we systematically investigated the roles of some of these variables in multiple approaches to lipid analysis of plasma samples from healthy adults by considering: \emph{1}) different sample introduction methods (separation vs. DI methods); \emph{2}) different MS instruments; and \emph{3}) between-laboratory differences in comparable analytical platforms. Each of these experimental variables resulted in different quantitative results, even with the inclusion of isotope-labeled internal standards for individual lipid classes. We demonstrated that appropriate normalization to commonly available reference samples (i.e., "shared references") can largely correct for these systematic method-specific quantitative biases. Thus, to harmonize data in the field of lipidomics, in-house long-term references should be complemented by a commonly available shared reference sample, such as NIST SRM 1950, in the case of human plasma.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
